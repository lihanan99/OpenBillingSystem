OpenBillingSystem
=================

With the permission of my former supervisor, I'm allowed to work on the billing system & implement the code of what I learned in the past intern experience as a open project.

This is a on going project. There are 3 Big part of the system:

part 1 DMS (Data Mining System) this is mainly used to collect the information of the installed Linux system, it will send its "online time", which are used to calculate each account service fees, to a receiver and then push to the database.

Part 2 SQL or DataBase part. Once we have all our information in the SQL. We can use a PL/SQL trigger to finalized our update every 30 days.


Part 3 Web Billing System, which is used to handle checking and update service, check fees, add manager/admin/client.
